    <h2>Data Files</h2>

    <h2>Scenario</h2>
    <p>You work for Mixed Messages Media, a marketing firm. One of the firm's clients is a large wholesale distributor. The distributor sells many different kinds of products to various retail stores, but specializes in selling food products. As part of a marketing push, you've been hired to help the distributor with its customer segmentation approach. The distributor wants to be able to target their advertisements to specific retailers in order to maximize sales. You've been given historical data that includes annual spending figures for each of the distributor's retail clients for several product categories (paper products, frozen products, milk products, etc.). There is no label associated with this data, so your mission will be to try to assign the retailers to meaningful groups based on how much they spend for each type of product. So, you'll use a clustering approach to this data.</p>

    <h2>Attributes of the Dataset</h2>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Attribute</th>
            <th>Annual Spending On</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Fresh</td>
            <td>Fresh products</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Milk</td>
            <td>Milk products</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Grocery</td>
            <td>Grocery products</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Frozen</td>
            <td>Frozen products</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Detergents_Paper</td>
            <td>Detergent products and paper products</td>

            <td>Deli products</td>
